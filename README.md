This is a program which will take in an audio file and attempt to output equivalent sheet music.

The frequency generating engine is the C library Aubio.

Motivation:
Inherently, this problem is not intractable, because humans can detect different instruments, and different notes. So, the idea is to take what we hear, and make the computer hear it an map it out.
